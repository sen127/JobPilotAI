Dear Bain & Company Recruitment Team,

I am excited to apply for the Strategy Analyst position. With an MBA from McGill, hands-on experience leading digital transformation at BMO, and a proven track record as the founder of an AI startup, I bring a strategic mindset and technical expertise aligned with Bain’s commitment to driving impactful client outcomes.

At BMO, I led a $45M platform migration, designing and overseeing robust financial models to guide business decisions and ensure ROI. My experience as a delivery lead sharpened my ability to manage complex projects, facilitate executive workshops, and communicate across stakeholder groups to drive consensus and results.

Building Aemete enabled me to bridge technical innovation with commercial strategy—skills I reinforced by teaching business analysis and translating technical concepts into actionable plans for clients.

I am eager to leverage my analytical rigor and leadership experience to deliver transformative solutions at Bain. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
