Dear Bain & Company Recruitment Team,

I am excited to apply for the Strategy Analyst position. With an MBA from McGill, hands-on experience as a Delivery Lead at BMO, and a track record of building and scaling an AI startup, I am confident in my ability to drive impactful client solutions and deliver strategic value to Bain.

At BMO, I led a $45M platform migration, navigating complex stakeholder environments and delivering projects on time and within budget. My role demanded rigorous financial analysis and a sharp focus on business outcomesâ€”skills I further honed while founding Aemete, where I developed data-driven strategies to accelerate growth in a competitive market. Additionally, my experience teaching business analysis has given me a solid foundation in communicating complex ideas and fostering collaboration.

I am eager to bring my corporate strategy expertise, client delivery experience, and analytical rigor to Bain & Company. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
