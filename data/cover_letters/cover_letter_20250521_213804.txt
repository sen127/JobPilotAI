Dear Bain & Company Recruitment Team,

I am excited to apply for the Strategy Analyst position. With an MBA from McGill, leadership experience at BMO, and a proven record of driving business transformation, I am confident in my ability to deliver immediate value to your clients.

At BMO, I led a $45M platform migration, where I built robust financial models to optimize resource allocation and drive executive decision-making. As Delivery Lead, I facilitated cross-functional workshops that aligned stakeholders and accelerated project delivery. My entrepreneurial experience founding the AI startup Aemete further honed my analytical and client engagement skills, as I developed scalable solutions and guided organizations through digital transformation.

Having taught business analysis, I bring a structured approach to solving complex problems and leading client workshops. I am eager to leverage my technical, financial, and facilitation expertise to help Bain’s clients achieve lasting impact.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
